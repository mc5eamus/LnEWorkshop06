# Whiteboard Design Session 2: Data

## Requirements
Outline functional and non-functional requirements for the data architecture. Make assumptions where the provided information is not sufficient. Document your conclusions in terms of
* types of data your solution will have to deal with
* their quantity structure
* reliability and scaling
* security and compliance

## Data Platform Candidates
Apply the architecture framework to identify Azure Data Platform candidates for your solution and document your decision. 
Do they natively support the design patterns you considered relevant? Investigate [limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits) associated with the selected technologies.

## Validate across quality dimensions
Match the selected technologies with the questions from the [quality dimension catalog](quality_pillars_checklist.md) you selected previously. Do the capabilities of the services allow you to appropriately respond to them? Document your findings.

## Partitioning strategy
Identify your partitioning strategy to support scalability and find your way around limitations, refer to the [Architecture Framework Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/data-partitioning-strategies). Document your findings.

## Checklist
Recap the quality aspects you selected in the previous session. Refer to the [quality dimensions checklist](quality_pillars_checklist.md) and verify which options of addressing data-related requirements you considered in your solution.

# Summary and Presentation
Consolidate your findings and prepare a 10' presentation in a chalk-talk format.
