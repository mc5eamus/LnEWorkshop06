# Whiteboard Design Session 4: DevOps

## System Health
How would you design and implement system health monitoring? Does the solution design provide the required data?

## Critical Incident Management
From the Operations Management perspective, visualize 2-3 scenarios that may affect the operations at different scales (appliance failure, local power outage, missing internet connectivity, cloud service disruption). Have those scenarios been addressed in the solution design? How would a resolution process look like? How much impact would you expect? What are your considerations for risk management and SLA design?

## Testing
Which strategies and patterns would you suggest adopting to ensure that tests can validate the implemented functionality?

## DevOps Quality Dimensions
Recap the quality aspects you selected in the first session. Refer to the [quality dimensions checklist](quality_pillars_checklist.md) and verify which options of addressing DevOps-related requirements you considered in your solution.

## Retrospective
From the DevOps / COO perspective, what recommendations would you give to yourself as architects (day 1 activity)?

# Summary and Presentation
Consolidate your findings and prepare a 10' presentation in a chalk-talk format.
